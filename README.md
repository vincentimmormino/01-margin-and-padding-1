# 01-margin-and-padding-1
In this project, I am working with margin and padding to position elements.
Through this project, I developed a better understanding of the differences
between margin and padding, as well as how "margin: auto" works.
I'd only ever seen that used to center elements, so I had no clue you could
align elements to the left or right by doing "margin-right: auto" and
"margin-left: auto" respectively!
